# ASLAI
Testing various image classification methods for American Sign Language fingerspelling.
J and Z are excluded because these signs are dynamic. Because of these exclusions the goal is to create a 24 class model.

# TO DO
1. clean dataset
  - I have data I've collected myself but it is messy and could be causing me problems
2. train using RNN I have already created
3. train using other models
4. upload findings.
